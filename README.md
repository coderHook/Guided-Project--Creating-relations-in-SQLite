# Project - Relations with SQLite

 - In this guided project, we will walk through how to normalize our single table into multiple tables and how to create relations between them.

 Our database file, nominations.db, contains just the nominations table. This table has the following schema:

Year - the year of the awards ceremony, integer type.
Category - the category of award the nominee was nominated for, text type.
Nominee - the person nominated for the award, text type.
Movie - the movie the nominee participated in, text type.
Character - the name of the character the nominee played, text type.
Won - if this nominee won the award, integer type.
